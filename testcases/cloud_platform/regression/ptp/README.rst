Precision Time Protocol (PTP) Test Automation
==============================================

Overview
========

This directory contains automated tests for the Precision Time Protocol (PTP) functionality in StarlingX. These tests validate that time synchronization works correctly across the cloud platform.

What is PTP?
-----------

PTP (Precision Time Protocol, IEEE 1588) is a protocol used to synchronize clocks throughout a computer network. Unlike NTP (Network Time Protocol) which typically provides millisecond accuracy, PTP achieves clock accuracy in the sub-microsecond (less than one millionth of a second) range, making it essential for telecommunications, industrial automation, and financial trading systems.

**Why PTP is Important for StarlingX:**
PTP enables critical timing-sensitive applications in telecommunications by ensuring all network devices operate with the same precise time reference. This is essential for:

- 5G network synchronization
- Radio access network (RAN) timing
- Mobile backhaul synchronization
- Industrial automation
- Financial transaction timestamping

**How PTP Works:**
1. Special hardware in network cards creates timestamps when packets are sent and received
2. These timestamps are used to calculate network delay and clock offset
3. Slave clocks adjust their time based on these calculations
4. The system continuously monitors and adjusts to maintain synchronization

**Key PTP Concepts:**

- **Grandmaster Clock**: The primary reference clock that provides time to the network. Usually synchronized to GPS/GNSS or another highly accurate external source.

- **Boundary Clock (BC)**: A clock with multiple network connections that can synchronize to a master and serve as a time source for other clocks. Acts as both a slave (to upstream) and master (to downstream).

- **Transparent Clock (TC)**: A device that measures packet delay as it passes through and adds this information to help improve accuracy.

- **Ordinary Clock (OC)**: A clock with a single network connection, acting as either master or slave.

- **Time Slave Clock**: A clock that synchronizes to a master but doesn't provide time to other devices.

- **GNSS**: Global Navigation Satellite System provides an external time reference (like GPS, GLONASS, Galileo). Provides extremely accurate time derived from atomic clocks in satellites.

- **Holdover**: Operation mode when external reference is lost but clock continues based on previous synchronization. Quality of holdover depends on the stability of local oscillators.

- **PPS (Pulse Per Second)**: A precise electrical signal that pulses exactly once per second, used to synchronize hardware clocks.

- **Hardware Timestamping**: Special hardware in network cards that timestamps packets at the physical layer for greater accuracy.

To run a specific test:

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m pytest starlingx/testcases/cloud_platform/regression/ptp/test_ptp.py::test_ptp_operation_gnss_disable -v

Test Cases
=========

test_ptp_operation_gnss_disable
-----------------------------

**Purpose**: Verify PTP behavior when GNSS signal is lost and then restored.

**Steps**:
1. Turn off GNSS for Controller-0 NIC1 using GPIO control
2. Verify alarms are triggered (100.119)
3. Verify clock class degradation (248 for holdover mode)
4. Verify PMC configuration with GNSS off
5. Turn GNSS back on
6. Verify alarms clear
7. Verify clock class restoration (6 for normal operation)
8. Verify PMC configuration after restoration

**Expected Results**: 
- When GNSS is off, system should enter holdover mode with appropriate alarms
- When GNSS is restored, system should return to normal operation with alarms cleared

test_ptp_operation_phc_ctl_time_change
------------------------------------

**Purpose**: Verify PTP behavior when hardware clocks are manually adjusted.

**Steps**:
1. Start phc_ctl loop on controller-0 NIC1 to introduce time drift
2. Verify out-of-tolerance alarms are triggered
3. Stop the adjustment and verify alarms clear
4. Repeat the process for controller-1 NIC2

**Expected Results**:
- Manual clock adjustments should trigger out-of-tolerance alarms
- When adjustments stop, system should recover and alarms should clear

Common Alarms
============

- **100.119**: PTP-related alarms including:
  - "not locked to remote PTP Grand Master"
  - "GNSS signal loss state: holdover"
  - "1PPS signal loss state: holdover"
  - "PTP clocking is out of tolerance"

Alarm severity levels:
- **Major**: Service affecting issues (GNSS signal loss, no lock to master)
- **Minor**: Non-service affecting issues (out of tolerance)

Troubleshooting
==============

Common Issues and Solutions
-------------------------

1. **GNSS Signal Loss** (Error: "GNSS signal loss state: invalid")

   **Symptoms:**
   - Major alarm 100.119 with message "GNSS signal loss state: invalid"
   - PTP instances enter holdover mode
   - Clock class changes from 6 to 248

   **Solutions:**
   - **Check physical setup:**
     - Ensure GNSS antenna has clear view of the sky (ideally outdoors or near window)
     - Verify antenna cable is properly connected to the GNSS receiver
     - Check if antenna has power (active antennas require power)
   
   - **Verify GNSS power control:**
     - Run `./yow2-beagleboneblack-xxx.exp <gpio_port> on` to power on GNSS
     - Check if BeagleBone Black is properly connected and powered
   
   - **Improve signal detection:**
     - Add `ts2phc.extts_polarity=both` parameter to ts2phc configuration
     - This allows detection of both rising and falling edges of PPS signal
     - Restart ts2phc service after configuration change

2. **PTP Not Synchronizing** (Error: "not locked to remote PTP Grand Master")

   **Symptoms:**
   - Major alarm 100.119 with message "not locked to remote PTP Grand Master"
   - Port state shows as "LISTENING" or "FAULTY" instead of "MASTER" or "SLAVE"
   - PMC commands show incorrect parent data

   **Solutions:**
   - **Check network connectivity:**
     - Verify network cables are properly connected between all nodes
     - Run `ping` tests between controllers and compute nodes
     - Check for network errors with `ethtool -S <interface>`
   
   - **Verify PTP configuration:**
     - Ensure interface mappings in JSON5 file match actual hardware
     - Check that all required PTP instances are running with `systemctl status ptp4l@*`
     - Verify domain numbers match across all instances
   
   - **Hardware timestamping:**
     - Confirm hardware timestamping is enabled: `ethtool -T <interface>`
     - Verify PTP hardware clock exists: `ls /dev/ptp*`
     - Check driver support: `dmesg | grep ptp`

3. **Out of Tolerance Alarms** (Error: "PTP clocking is out of tolerance")

   **Symptoms:**
   - Minor alarm 100.119 with message "PTP clocking is out of tolerance by X microsecs"
   - System continues to operate but with degraded timing accuracy
   - Large offset values in PTP statistics

   **Solutions:**
   - **Check for network issues:**
     - Look for network congestion or packet loss
     - Verify QoS settings prioritize PTP traffic
     - Check for sources of jitter in the network
   
   - **Verify hardware connections:**
     - Ensure SMA connections are secure and properly terminated
     - Check for signal integrity issues with oscilloscope if available
     - Verify cable quality and length (shorter is better)
   
   - **Configuration tuning:**
     - Adjust `tx_timestamp_timeout` parameter if needed
     - Consider increasing `logSyncInterval` for more frequent synchronization
     - Check for proper delay mechanism configuration

Diagnostic Commands and Interpretation
--------------------------------

Below are essential commands for diagnosing PTP issues, along with explanations of what to look for in the output:

.. code-block:: bash

    # Check PTP daemon status for specific instance
    systemctl status ptp4l@ptp1
    # Look for: "Active: active (running)" and no error messages

    # View PTP logs for detailed synchronization information
    cat /var/log/ptp4l.log
    # Look for: "selected best master" messages and offset values
    # Good offset values should be in nanoseconds, not microseconds

    # Check GNSS status through CGU (Clock Generation Unit)
    cat /sys/kernel/debug/ice/<pci_address>/cgu
    # Look for: 
    # - "GNSS-1PPS state: valid" (good) or "invalid" (problem)
    # - "EEC DPLL status: locked_ho_acq" (good) or "holdover" (problem)
    # - "PPS DPLL status: locked_ho_acq" (good) or "holdover" (problem)

    # Find PCI address for your NIC
    grep PCI_SLOT_NAME /sys/class/net/enp81s0f2/device/uevent
    # Example output: PCI_SLOT_NAME=0000:81:00.2

    # View current PTP configuration and status
    pmc -u -b 0 'GET CURRENT_DATA_SET'
    # Look for: "offsetFromMaster" (should be small, <100ns is excellent)
    
    pmc -u -b 0 'GET PARENT_DATA_SET'
    # Look for: "parentPortIdentity" (shows which clock you're synchronized to)
    
    pmc -u -b 0 'GET TIME_PROPERTIES_DATA_SET'
    # Look for: "timeSource" (should be 0x20 for GNSS or 0x60 for PTP)
    
    pmc -u -b 0 'GET GRANDMASTER_SETTINGS_NP'
    # Look for: "clockClass" (6=synchronized to GNSS, 248=holdover)

    # Check for PTP alarms
    fm alarm-list | grep ptp
    # Common alarm IDs: 100.119 (PTP-related alarms)
    
    # Check hardware timestamping capability
    ethtool -T enp81s0f2
    # Look for: "hardware-transmit" and "hardware-receive" capabilities
    
    # Monitor PTP synchronization in real-time
    watch -n 1 "pmc -u -b 0 'GET CURRENT_DATA_SET' | grep offsetFromMaster"
    # Values should be stable and small (nanoseconds range)
    
    # Check if ts2phc is properly detecting GNSS signal
    journalctl -u ts2phc@ts1 -f
    # Look for: "extts" events occurring once per second

**Understanding Clock Class Values:**

- **6**: Synchronized to primary reference (GNSS) - Optimal
- **7**: Synchronized to primary reference but holdover capable - Good
- **13-14**: Synchronized to application-specific source - Acceptable
- **52**: Degraded reference but synchronized - Warning
- **187**: In holdover but within specifications - Warning
- **193**: In holdover, out of specifications - Problem
- **248**: Default/Holdover/Uncalibrated - Problem
- **255**: Slave-only clock - Normal for slave devices
